**I develop algorithms to help autonomous robots operate in extreme environments like the Moon, microgravity, and underwater.**

I'm currently at [NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab](https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/) and will be joining [USC](https://viterbi.usc.edu/) in fall 2025.

I'm broadly interested in autonomy for mobile robotic systems operating when conditions are uncertain, unknown, or unstructured. My work integrates tools from optimal control, reinforcement learning, and motion planning, and, increasingly, their interplay with perception for these scenarios. This theme blends real-world assumptions and constraints with environment-aware algorithm design to let robots work where they currently can't.
